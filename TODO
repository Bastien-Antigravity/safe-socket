# Research: Cross-Language SHM Event Triggering

Goal: Enable a process (Server) to write data to Shared Memory and immediately trigger a specific function or the main loop in a target process (Client), even if they are written in different languages (e.g., Go <-> C++/Python).

Challenges:
- Raw function pointers cannot be shared or executed across different process address spaces or runtimes.

Proposed Research:
- Investigate IPC Signaling mechanisms (System Semaphores, Named Pipes, EventFD) to provide the "Trigger" capability alongside the SHM "Data" capability.
- Design a language-agnostic "Event Protocol" where the client registers a local callback that is invoked when the SHM signal is received.
